# Nadeem Ahmed

My name is Nadeem, and i used to be a software engineer. At least, that was what i formally studied in college.

Now, I just completed my masters degree in computer science from St. Xavier's College. How did i get from point A to point B you ask? Read on...

###About Me

I was fortunate enough to know from a young age that i wanted to be an engineer;the engineering way of thinking came naturally to me. What i don't know was the type of engineer I wanted to be. When push came to shove, I choose Software engineering because it was most committal.

Truth be told, what I really enjoy, and what i really want to be, is learn. When i graduated from #Xavier's and now seeking for a Software Developer job.
