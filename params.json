At least, that was what i \r\nformally studied in college.\r\n\r\nNow, I just completed my masters degree in computer science from St. Xavier's College. \r\nHow did i get from point A to point B you ask? Read on...\r\n\r\n### About Me \r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough to know from a young age that i wanted to be an engineer;the \r\nengineering way of thinking came naturally to me. What i don't know was the type of \r\nengineer I wanted to be. When push came to shove, I choose Software engineering \r\nbecause it was most committal.\r\n\r\nTruth be told, what I really enjoy, and what i really want to be, is learn. When i \r\ngraduated from #Xavier's and now seeking for a Software Developer job.",
